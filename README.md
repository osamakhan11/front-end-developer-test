# Frontend developer test for Bluewinds

This test is for a career position at BlueWinds and will test your front-end skills.

## Purpose
The intended purpose is to test your front-end skills, ranging from UI design, and CSS, to integrating APIs


## Design tasks

1. Goto the link [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/images/food).
2. Analyze the design, you need to make something similar to this page, but of course, it won't be dynamic. It would be a static page.
3. The closer you get to the design, the more you score.
4. Mobile-first Pleaaaassseee!!!!

## API tasks

1. You have a section called [Popular categories](https://ibb.co/C9y8wQp)
2. You need to integrate this [API](https://demo2.meals4u.net/fe/api.test.php), so popular categories will only be a dynamic area in this page.

## Tools and technologies

As most of our products are in VueJs so we will highly recommend you use VueJs for this. But you can use Angular or React if you are really good in that.

## How to submit?
1. Fork this repository
2. Do your tasks
3. Commit your changes
4. Push them
5. Add "How to run instruction" in the area below

## How to run?
Step1: Need to run command into the folder "yarn add bootstrap react-bootstrap"
Step2: Need to run command into the folder "yarn add react-icons"

I have integrated the API with my react project.
